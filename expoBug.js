While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently crash without providing any helpful error messages in the console.  The app would appear to build successfully but fail to start or reload, leading to significant development downtime. This was particularly frustrating because the behavior was inconsistent; sometimes the development server would function without any issues, and other times it would randomly crash.
